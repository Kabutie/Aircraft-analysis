**Introduction**  


For this project, we will use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder for the business problem below.

**Business Problem**

Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.


**Business Understanding**

Stakeholder: Head of the new aviation division.

Goal: To identify which aircraft models are the lowest risk for the company to invest in for commercial and private use.

Research questions: 
-Which aircraft model has the lowest risk based on the dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023.
-Which aircraft models have the fewest accidents or fatalities?

-What causes are most common for different aircraft categories?



**Data Understanding**

-The Dataset is sourced from kaggle, the National Transportation Safety Board Dataset that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023.

-The data is about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

-It contains two csv files 'AviationData.csv' and 'USState_Codes.csv'.
